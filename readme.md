# UdonRandomSounds

Add spooky randomized positional sounds to your VRChat world (similar to Minecraft cave noises).

## Installation

Drag the .unitypackage from releases into your Unity project and import everything.

## Usage

- Drag the prefab from Cekay/RandomSounds/Prefabs into your scene
- Define the audio files you'd like to use under the 'Clips' field of the prefab
- Resize the 'Global Bounds' box collider to cover the area you'd like sounds to occur in
- Adjust the audio source's volume and falloff to be appropriate for your scene
