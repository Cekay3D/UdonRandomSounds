# UdonRandomSounds

Add spooky randomized positional sounds to your VRChat world (similar to Minecraft cave noises).

## Demo world

I developed this for my [Spookality 2023 world](https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_9d208dec-a077-479c-a090-9f2ae3434920), you can see it in action there.

## Installation

Drag the .unitypackage from releases into your Unity project and import everything.

## Usage

- Drag the prefab from Cekay/RandomSounds/Prefabs into your scene
- Define the audio files you'd like to use under the 'Clips' field of the prefab
- Resize the 'Global Bounds' box collider to cover the area you'd like sounds to occur in
- Adjust the audio source's volume and falloff to be appropriate for your scene
